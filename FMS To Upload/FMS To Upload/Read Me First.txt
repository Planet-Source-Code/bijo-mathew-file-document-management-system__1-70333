hi guys
i am back with a new project, must check project!!! 

!!! you need Adobe PDF write to convert scanned files to PDF (works without that too but you need to comment the PDF conversion part of the code in module "modDoc2Pdf")!!!
This time its a File Management System / Doc Management System, 
as usual industrial standard solution, but pls note you need Adobe PDF write to convert 
scanned files to PDF


You can assign rights to files like View,Print,Copy, Edit etc
